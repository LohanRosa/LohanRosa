### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently talking about SQL, Data Analytics, Statistics, Python, Power BI and Business!

I'm so happy because I started my career as a full stack developer. I'm studying systems analysis and development college!

I'm learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScrips, PHP, MySQL, NodeJS, API's Git and GitHub!

I'm working on my career transition to a Data and full stack developer, before that i'm production engineer with MBA in Management.
